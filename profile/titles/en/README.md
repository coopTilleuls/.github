# Titles for programmers

> We're introducing Titles for programmers forked from [basecamp handbook](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook). These titles will help us specify a salary grid and normalize salaries at Les-Tilleuls.

- [Voir la version française](../README.md)

We use the following criteria to assess the level and title of programmers of [Les-Tilleuls.coop](https://les-tilleuls.coop). These criteria aren’t exhaustive, and they aren’t mere checklists. They’re a guidance to having an individualized discussion about career progression.

It should also be noted that these criteria chiefly examine the scope of work someone is capable of tackling independently. In addition to that assessment, we also look at the quality of the execution itself. <!-- reword this: Basecamp pays in the top 10% of the industry (based on San Francisco rates), so the quality of the work itself should be commensurate with that target. -->
