# First steps

Before your venue, Eleftheria (our HR officer) will contact you to find out about your material needs. In addition to that, here is what your first day with us will be like:

- [ ] You will get your computer (we let you choose between a MacBook Pro or a Dell under Linux)
- [ ] You get your welcome kit (including a shirt, a sweatshirt, a thermos, a coffee cup, pens and other goodies)

You will get your access to your different accounts:
- [ ] Google workspace for emails, online chat, calendar and drive
- [ ] We will add your GitHub account to our organization
- [ ] You will receive an invitation to Loomio (our interface allowing you to vote on various decisions (budgets, HR...)
- [ ] You will receive an invitation to SalesForce (our ERP)
- [ ] Several documents will have to be signed (your contract, health insurance documentation, GDPR certificate...)
- [ ] If you are ok, we also add your picture on the team page of our website
- [ ] On the technical side, you must now [setup your computer](installation.md)!
- [ ] Finally, it's time to welcome you on our chat!

Once these things are done, our HR officer will schedule several meetings with you so that you can meet our different departments. These meetings will allow you to discover in depth the subjects on which we work on a daily basis.

If you have any questions (technical or organizational), do not hesitate, we are here to help you.

Welcome aboard!
